1. Basic Class and Object
Problem: Create a Car class with attributes like brand and model. Then create an instance of this class.
2. Class Method and Self
Problem: Add a method to the Car class that displays the full name of the car (brand and model).
3. Inheritance
Problem: Create an ElectricCar class that inherits from the Car class and has an additional attribute battery_size.
4. Encapsulation
Problem: Modify the Car class to encapsulate the brand attribute, making it private, and provide a getter method for it.
5. Polymorphism
Problem: Demonstrate polymorphism by defining a method fuel_type in both Car and ElectricCar classes, but with different behaviors.
6. Class Variables
Problem: Add a class variable to Car that keeps track of the number of cars created.
7. Static Method
Problem: Add a static method to the Car class that returns a general description of a car.
8. Property Decorators
Problem: Use a property decorator in the Car class to make the model attribute read-only.
9. Class Inheritance and isinstance() Function
Problem: Demonstrate the use of isinstance() to check if my_tesla is an instance of Car and ElectricCar.
10. Multiple Inheritance
Problem: Create two classes Battery and Engine, and let the ElectricCar class inherit from both, demonstrating multiple inheritance.
